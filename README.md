# iOS App README

This iOS app is a simple SwiftUI application that primarily displays a "Hello World" text on the screen. The app is built using [Trace AI](https://trace.zip) and can be demoed at [this link](https://trace.zip/c/118c37e9-a9e2-4416-afc5-3ac53c9b9ac8).

## Building the App

To build the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Xcode project file.
3. Build and run the app on the iOS simulator or a physical device.

## Code Overview

The main view of the app is defined in the `ContentView` struct, which conforms to the `View` protocol. The `body` property of the `ContentView` struct returns a `Text` view displaying the "Hello World" message.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
  var body: some View {
    Text("Hello World")
    // write your Swift UI code here
  }
}
```

The `ContentView_Previews` struct is used to provide a preview of the `ContentView` in the Xcode canvas. This struct conforms to the `PreviewProvider` protocol and returns an instance of `ContentView` in its `previews` property.

```swift
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
  static var previews: some View {
    ContentView()
  }
}
```

As you make changes to the code, the app will update accordingly. To see the changes, simply build and run the app again.
